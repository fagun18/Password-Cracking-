# Password-Cracking

Building a password cracking script is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of various cracking techniques and algorithms. It's also important to note that using a password cracking script for illegal or unauthorized activities is strictly prohibited and can result in serious consequences.

Here's an example of how you can use the Python library hashlib to create a simple script that cracks a password using a brute-force method:

This script uses the "md5" function to hash the password and compare it with the hashed password that we want to crack. It then uses a brute-force method to try all possible combinations of characters up to 8 characters long.

It's important to note that this script is an example of a very simple, unsophisticated cracking method that would not be effective against most real-world passwords, and it takes a very long time to crack a password even with a simple password.

Modern passwords are generally much more complex and harder to crack using brute-force methods, and cracking tools like John the Ripper, hashcat, and oclHashcat are more effective.

Additionally, cracking someone's password without their consent is illegal in many jurisdictions, and even with consent, it can be considered unethical. It's crucial to follow the laws of your country and obtain proper legal authorization before attempting to crack any password.
